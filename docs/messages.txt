    Outgoing Messages:
        Welcome Message (Sent as response to Registration):

            QUERY_REJECTION, Account ID
            Note: We can use QUERY_RESPONSE, just need to know what Verdict should be. I was thinking
                  we could use a boolean (true if able to place hold, false otherwise), but am willing
                  to work with other primitives.
        Update Balance (Sent as response to Transfer and Balance Updates):
            AVAILABLE_FUNDS, Current Available Funds (Will consider all holds, thus it is not the actual
            amount of funds in the account)
        Auction House Update List (Sent as reponse to Auction House Request):
            UPDATED_LIST, List of Socket Address belonging to Auction House Servers
